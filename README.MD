# python-http-server

An HTTP server built from scratch with python. This project builds upon the [crude-server](https://github.com/bhch/crude-server) by [bhch](https://github.com/bhch/).

The goal of this project is to get a better understanding of the HTTP Protocol. I will be improving on the code base from time to time.
